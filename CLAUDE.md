# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RummyScorer is a React Native mobile app for tracking scores in Indian Rummy games. It supports three game variants: Pool Rummy (101/201/250 point elimination), Points Rummy, and Deals Rummy.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
bundle install                    # Ruby dependencies (one-time)
bundle exec pod install           # iOS CocoaPods (from ios/ directory)

# Development
npm start                         # Start Metro bundler
npm run ios                       # Build and run iOS app
npm run android                   # Build and run Android app

# Testing and linting
npm test                          # Run Jest tests
npm run lint                      # Run ESLint
```

## Architecture

**Tech Stack**: React Native 0.83.1, React 19, TypeScript, React Navigation (Native Stack)

**State Management**: React Context API (`src/context/GameContext.tsx`) with AsyncStorage persistence. The `GameProvider` manages all game state including current game, players, rounds, and scoring.

**Navigation Flow**:
- Home → GameSetup → Game → History
- 4 screens in `src/screens/`: HomeScreen, GameSetupScreen, GameScreen, HistoryScreen

**Key Types** (`src/types/game.ts`):
- `GameVariant`: 'pool' | 'points' | 'deals'
- `Game`: Complete game state (players, rounds, config, winner)
- `Player`: name, score, isEliminated
- `Round`: scores per player, round winner, timestamp

**Scoring Logic** (in GameContext):
- Invalid declaration: 80 points (pool) or entered value (other variants)
- Declared winner: 0 points
- Pool Rummy: Players eliminated at poolLimit, last remaining wins
- Deals Rummy: After numberOfDeals, lowest scorer wins

**Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage with key 'currentGame', auto-saved on every state change

## Theming System

**Theme Context** (`src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`): Provides dynamic theming with 5 color themes (Midnight, Light, Ocean Blue, Forest Green, Royal Purple). Theme selection is persisted via AsyncStorage.

**Theme Definitions** (`src/theme/index.ts`):
- `ThemeColors`: Interface defining all color tokens (background, accent, labels, chart colors, etc.)
- `themes`: Record of all 5 themes
- `Typography`: iOS Dynamic Type scale constants
- `Spacing`: 4-point grid system (xs=4, sm=8, md=16, lg=24, xl=32)
- `IconSize`: Standardized icon sizes (small=16, medium=20, large=24, xlarge=40, xxlarge=60)

**Icons**: Uses SF Symbols via `react-native-sfsymbols` with `src/components/Icon.tsx` wrapper. All icons follow Apple HIG with 44pt minimum tap targets.

**Usage Pattern**: Components use `useTheme()` hook and `createStyles(colors)` function for dynamic styling:
```typescript
const { colors } = useTheme();
const styles = useMemo(() => createStyles(colors), [colors]);
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Uses Husky + lint-staged to validate code before commits:
- **ESLint**: Catches missing imports, unused variables, and code issues
- **TypeScript**: Type-checks staged files to catch type errors

Hooks run automatically on `git commit`. To skip (not recommended): `git commit --no-verify`

## Platform Configuration

- iOS: CocoaPods, Swift (AppDelegate.swift), min iOS via react_native_pods.rb
- Android: Gradle, minSdk 24, targetSdk 36, Hermes enabled, New Architecture enabled
- Node.js: >= 20 required
